## My Portfolio
This project was made to display my most recent projects in a more accessible way. It contains one scrollable page with some information about myself and how to get in contact with me.

You can also check the deployed version using GitHub Pages [Here](https://blin125.github.io/my-portfolio/)

## Running:

* To get started, make sure to install all the required dependencies onto your project folder by using `npm install`. 

* To run the app, you can use `npm start`, which runs the app in development mode.

* Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

* The page will reload when you make changes.

* You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Additional Features

* At the moment, there are not many projects on the page, but once it grows more, I am thinking about adding a search function and a pagination variant.

* The LinkedIn, Email, and GitHub links have a cool on-hover feature to bring users' attention to them. However, features that incentivize the user to contact me are not very obvious and are sometimes clunky, so I am thinking of updating it.

* I am currently using a combination of React state management, Intersection Observer API, and direct DOM manipulations. However, Sometimes, upon user scrolling, the navbar that represents the section the user is reading is not updated as accurately as I would like. So, I will look at techniques to improve its accuracy.
